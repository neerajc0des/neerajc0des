# Hi There ![75695-hey-wumpus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3883f941-3d2c-4c99-80ce-1764658ae8f8)


I’m <a href="#">Neeraj<a>, a frontend design engineer based in India.

I love turning design ideas into lightning-fast, accessible interfaces that feel effortless.

Outside of code and Figma, you’ll find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or drawing.

Fun Facts:
* I don’t like tea.
* Interstellar is my favourite movie.
